My C# port of Manwe's competetive programming classes

Manwe's AI tools are a great resource for bot programmers, but were written in java, which I am not proficient enough in to be competetive.  Hence, with his blessing I took them and ported them to my weapon of choice, C#.

This port contains everything he had in his library as of August 2016, with some additions of my own.  I chose to keep my own versions of some things, like the Point and Vector classes and my file merge app, in order to take advantage of some language-specific perks.

Manwe's project has been expanded with more classes and a C++ version since the port, and can be found at https://github.com/Manwe56/competitive-programming .  I haven't made an effort to keep my stuff in sync, though at some point I plan to update it to match again (unless Manwe does it first).
